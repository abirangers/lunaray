## Why

The current admin dashboard and CRUD interfaces need a modern redesign to improve user experience, visual appeal, and functionality. Based on 2025 design trends and user feedback, we need to:

- Modernize the visual design with contemporary UI patterns
- Enhance CRUD operations with better UX patterns
- Improve data visualization and dashboard metrics
- Add advanced filtering, search, and bulk operations
- Implement responsive design improvements
- Add dark/light mode support

## What Changes

- **Modern Dashboard Design**: Redesign admin dashboard with contemporary card layouts, improved typography, and better visual hierarchy
- **Enhanced CRUD Interfaces**: Improve table designs, form layouts, and user interactions for all CRUD operations
- **Advanced Data Tables**: Add search, filtering, sorting, pagination, and bulk operations
- **Interactive Components**: Implement modern UI components with Alpine.js
- **Responsive Improvements**: Optimize for mobile and tablet devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Add theme switching capability
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improve loading states and user feedback

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: web-platform (UI/UX improvements), user-management (CRUD enhancements), content-management (dashboard improvements)
- **Affected code**:
  - `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php` (layout redesign)
  - `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php` (dashboard redesign)
  - `resources/views/admin/users/` (user CRUD redesign)
  - `resources/views/articles/` (article CRUD redesign)
  - `resources/views/categories/` (category CRUD redesign)
  - `resources/css/app.css` (custom styling)
  - `resources/js/app.js` (Alpine.js enhancements)
- **Breaking changes**: None - this is a visual and UX enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Requires TailwindCSS 4, Alpine.js, and modern browser support
