## Why
The existing chatbot integration lacks proper MVP implementation with database persistence, session management, and comprehensive error handling. This proposal outlines the necessary changes to bring the chatbot system to production standards, ensuring reliable conversation history, robust error handling, and an enhanced user experience.

## What Changes
- Implement database persistence for all chat messages (user and bot).
- Enhance n8n webhook integration to include session context and robust error handling.
- Develop a comprehensive session management system for chat conversations.
- Integrate advanced UI/UX features into the chat interface, including message copy, auto-resize textarea, and message status indicators.
- Implement rate limiting and basic security measures for chatbot API endpoints.
- Ensure comprehensive logging and monitoring for chatbot interactions.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `chatbot-integration`
- Affected code: `app/Http/Controllers/ChatbotController.php`, `resources/views/user/chat.blade.php`, `app/Http/Middleware/ChatbotAccessMiddleware.php`, `database/migrations/*_create_chat_messages_table.php`, `database/migrations/*_create_chat_sessions_table.php`, `app/Models/ChatMessage.php`, `app/Models/ChatSession.php`, `routes/api.php`
