## Context

Lunaray Beauty Factory needs a hybrid authentication system that supports two distinct user types with different authentication methods and access levels. The system must be secure, user-friendly, and maintainable while providing clear separation between public users and staff members.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Implement secure hybrid authentication system
- Provide seamless Google OAuth for public users
- Maintain secure email/password authentication for staff
- Implement comprehensive role-based access control
- Create intuitive login/logout user experience
- Ensure proper separation of user types and permissions

### Non-Goals
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration with external systems
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation
- Social login providers other than Google
- Advanced user profile management features
- Password reset functionality (handled by Laravel's built-in system)

## Decisions

### Decision: Laravel Socialite for Google OAuth
- **Rationale**: Laravel Socialite provides robust OAuth integration with minimal configuration
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - Custom OAuth implementation (too complex and error-prone)
  - Third-party OAuth packages (less maintained than Socialite)
- **Implementation**: Use Socialite's Google provider with proper error handling

### Decision: Hybrid Authentication Architecture
- **Rationale**: Different user types require different authentication methods for security and UX
- **Public Users**: Google OAuth for ease of use and reduced friction
- **Staff**: Email/password for better security control and admin management
- **Alternatives considered:
  - Single authentication method for all users (poor UX for public users)
  - Multiple OAuth providers (adds complexity without clear benefit)

### Decision: Role-Based Access Control with Spatie Laravel Permission
- **Rationale**: Leverage existing package from Fase 1 for consistent role management
- **Roles**: user (Google OAuth), content_manager (email/password), admin (email/password)
- **Permissions**: Granular permissions for different access levels
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Custom role system (reinventing the wheel)
  - Simple boolean flags (not scalable for complex permissions)

### Decision: Middleware-Based Route Protection
- **Rationale**: Laravel middleware provides clean, declarative route protection
- **Implementation**: Custom middleware for role-based access control
- **Benefits**: Easy to apply, test, and maintain
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Controller-based authorization (more verbose and error-prone)
  - Gate-based authorization (less flexible for complex scenarios)

### Decision: Separate Authentication Controllers
- **Rationale**: Different authentication methods require different logic and validation
- **Google OAuth Controller**: Handle OAuth callbacks and user creation
- **Staff Auth Controller**: Handle email/password authentication
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, easier testing and maintenance
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Single authentication controller (would become too complex)
  - Trait-based approach (less clear separation)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Google OAuth Dependency
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Track OAuth success rates and user feedback

### Risk: Security Vulnerabilities in Hybrid System
- **Mitigation**: Follow Laravel security best practices, regular security audits
- **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing for both authentication methods

### Risk: User Confusion with Two Login Methods
- **Mitigation**: Clear UI/UX design with obvious login method selection
- **User Education**: Provide clear instructions and help documentation

### Risk: Role Assignment Errors
- **Mitigation**: Automated role assignment with proper validation
- **Monitoring**: Log role assignments and provide admin oversight

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
- Install and configure Laravel Socialite
- Setup Google OAuth credentials and configuration
- Create basic authentication controllers
- Implement role and permission seeders

### Phase 2: Authentication Implementation (Week 2)
- Implement Google OAuth authentication
- Implement staff email/password authentication
- Create middleware for role-based access control
- Setup authentication routes and controllers

### Phase 3: UI and Testing (Week 3)
- Design and implement login/logout UI components
- Create responsive forms with TailwindCSS
- Add Alpine.js interactions
- Comprehensive testing of authentication flows

### Phase 4: Integration and Validation (Week 4)
- Integrate authentication with existing application
- Test role-based access control
- Validate security measures
- Performance testing and optimization

## Open Questions

- Should we implement automatic user role assignment based on email domain?
- Do we need to implement user account linking between Google OAuth and staff accounts?
- Should we add user activity logging for security auditing?
- Do we need to implement session management for different user types?
- Should we add user profile management for Google OAuth users?
