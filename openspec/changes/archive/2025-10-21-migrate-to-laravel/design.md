## Context

Lunaray Beauty Factory needs to migrate from WordPress to Laravel to support modern web features, better scalability, and integration with external services like n8n chatbot. The current WordPress setup limits their ability to provide advanced user experiences and integrate with modern APIs.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Modern, scalable web platform built with Laravel
- Seamless Google OAuth authentication
- Advanced content management system
- Chatbot integration via n8n webhook
- Responsive, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Role-based access control system
- Article management with search and categorization

### Non-Goals
- Data migration from existing WordPress
- Complex e-commerce functionality
- Custom chatbot AI development
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics integration

## Decisions

### Decision: Laravel Framework
- **Rationale**: Laravel provides robust MVC architecture, built-in authentication, and excellent ecosystem for modern web development
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - Next.js (too frontend-focused for this use case)
  - Django (Python ecosystem, but team prefers PHP)
  - Symfony (more complex, Laravel is more developer-friendly)

### Decision: Laravel Package Selection
- **ralphjsmit/laravel-seo**: For comprehensive SEO management including meta tags, sitemaps, and structured data
- **spatie/laravel-permission**: For robust role and permission management system
- **tonysm/rich-text-laravel**: For advanced rich text editing capabilities in articles
- **Alpine.js**: For lightweight, reactive frontend interactions without heavy JavaScript framework

### Decision: Laravel Blade Components Architecture
- **Blade Components**: Use Laravel's built-in Blade Components for reusable UI elements
- **Component Structure**: Create organized component hierarchy for maintainable code
- **Data Passing**: Utilize component attributes and slots for flexible data flow
- **Layout Components**: Implement layout components for consistent page structure
- **Form Components**: Create reusable form components for admin interfaces

### Decision: Hybrid Authentication System
- **Google OAuth for Users**: Simplifies public user registration/login process, reduces password management overhead
- **Email/Password for Staff**: Content managers and admins use traditional email/password authentication for better security control
- **Rationale**: Different user types have different security requirements and access patterns
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - All Google OAuth (less control over staff accounts)
  - All email/password (more complex for public users)
  - Multiple OAuth providers (adds complexity)

### Decision: Tailwind CSS for Styling
- **Rationale**: Utility-first CSS framework provides rapid development and consistent design
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Bootstrap (more opinionated, less flexible)
  - Custom CSS (more development time)
  - Material UI (too opinionated for brand customization)

### Decision: n8n Webhook Integration for Chatbot
- **Rationale**: Leverages existing n8n infrastructure, separates concerns, allows for easy chatbot logic updates
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Custom chatbot implementation (more development time)
  - Third-party chatbot services (additional costs and complexity)

### Decision: Fresh Start (No WordPress Migration)
- **Rationale**: Clean slate allows for better architecture, no legacy constraints
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - WordPress data migration (adds complexity, potential data quality issues)
  - Hybrid approach (maintains WordPress complexity)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: User Adoption of New Authentication
- **Mitigation**: Clear communication about Google OAuth benefits, simple migration process

### Risk: Chatbot Integration Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple webhook integration, iterate based on feedback

### Risk: Performance with Laravel
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching strategies, optimize database queries, use Laravel's built-in performance features

### Risk: Development Timeline
- **Mitigation**: Phased approach, prioritize core features first, iterative development

## Migration Plan
