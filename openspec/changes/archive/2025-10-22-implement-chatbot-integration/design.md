## Context
Lunaray Beauty Factory needs an AI-powered chatbot to provide instant customer support and answer beauty industry questions. The chatbot will integrate with n8n webhook to leverage external AI services without building custom AI infrastructure. This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and allows for easy AI model switching.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Provide instant, helpful responses to user queries
- Maintain session state and chat history
- Ensure secure communication with external services
- Deliver modern, responsive chat interface
- Support multiple concurrent users efficiently
- Provide administrative monitoring and logging

### Non-Goals
- Building custom AI models or training
- Real-time voice communication
- Advanced AI features like image recognition
- Multi-language support (initially)
- Chatbot learning from conversations

## Decisions

### Decision: n8n Webhook Integration
**What**: Use n8n webhook for AI communication instead of direct API integration
**Why**: 
- Provides flexibility to switch AI providers
- Allows complex workflow orchestration
- Reduces direct dependencies on AI services
- Enables easy testing and mocking

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct OpenAI API integration → Less flexible, harder to test
- Custom AI service → Too complex for initial implementation
- Third-party chatbot service → Less control, potential vendor lock-in

### Decision: Session-Based Chat History
**What**: Store chat history in database with session management
**Why**:
- Enables chat history persistence during session
- Allows administrative monitoring and logging
- Provides audit trail for compliance
- Supports future analytics and insights

**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side only storage → No persistence, no admin visibility
- Stateless approach → Poor user experience, no context

### Decision: Alpine.js for Frontend Interactivity
**What**: Use Alpine.js for chat interface interactivity
**Why**:
- Consistent with existing project stack
- Lightweight and performant
- Easy to integrate with Blade components
- Good for real-time updates without complexity

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vue.js → Overkill for chat interface
- Vanilla JavaScript → More complex to maintain
- React → Inconsistent with Laravel/Blade approach

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: n8n Webhook Dependency
**Risk**: Single point of failure if webhook is down
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provide fallback responses for common queries
- Monitor webhook health and alert on failures

### Risk: Performance Under Load
**Risk**: Database queries and webhook calls may slow down with many users
**Mitigation**:
- Implement database indexing for chat queries
- Add caching for frequently asked questions
- Use queue system for webhook calls
- Implement rate limiting per user

### Risk: Security of User Data
**Risk**: Sensitive user information sent to external webhook
**Mitigation**:
- Sanitize user input before sending to webhook
- Implement data anonymization for logging
- Use HTTPS for all webhook communication
- Add input validation and filtering

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create database tables and models
2. Implement basic webhook communication
3. Create simple chat interface
4. Add basic error handling

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Add session management and history
2. Implement typing indicators and animations
3. Add responsive design improvements
4. Create admin monitoring dashboard

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Add performance optimizations
2. Implement caching strategies
3. Add advanced error handling
4. Create comprehensive testing suite

### Rollback Plan
- Disable chatbot routes if issues occur
- Fallback to contact form for user support
- Maintain database integrity with proper migrations
- Keep webhook configuration flexible for quick changes

## Open Questions

- Should we implement chat message encryption for sensitive conversations?
- How should we handle chatbot responses that contain links or formatting?
- What is the optimal session timeout for chat history?
- Should we implement chat message search functionality?
- How should we handle chatbot responses in different languages?
