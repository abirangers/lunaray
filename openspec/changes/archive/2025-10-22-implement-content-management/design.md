## Context
The Lunaray Beauty Factory platform requires a comprehensive content management system to support the beauty industry with valuable articles, tutorials, and resources. The system needs to be user-friendly for content managers while providing powerful features for SEO and content organization.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: 
  - Easy-to-use content creation and management
  - SEO-optimized articles with proper meta data
  - Rich text editing with image support
  - Category-based content organization
  - Search and filtering capabilities
  - Content manager dashboard with analytics
- Non-Goals:
  - Complex workflow approval systems (future phase)
  - Multi-language content (future phase)
  - Advanced analytics beyond basic metrics

## Decisions
- Decision: Use tonysm/rich-text-laravel for rich text editing
  - Alternatives considered: TinyMCE, CKEditor, Quill
  - Rationale: Laravel-native package with good integration, supports image uploads
- Decision: Use ralphjsmit/laravel-seo for SEO features
  - Alternatives considered: Custom SEO implementation, other SEO packages
  - Rationale: Comprehensive SEO features, Laravel integration, active maintenance
- Decision: Implement category system with many-to-many relationship
  - Alternatives considered: Hierarchical categories, tags only
  - Rationale: Flexible content organization, supports multiple categories per article

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Rich text editor complexity → Provide clear documentation and training
- SEO package dependency → Monitor for updates and compatibility
- Image upload security → Implement proper validation and storage
- Performance with large content → Add caching and pagination

## Migration Plan
- No existing content to migrate
- Fresh implementation with proper database schema
- Gradual rollout with content manager training

## Open Questions
- Image storage strategy (local vs cloud)
- Content approval workflow requirements
- Analytics integration with external tools
