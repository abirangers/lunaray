## Context

The current admin interface uses basic TailwindCSS styling with minimal interactivity. Users have requested a more modern, professional appearance that matches 2025 design trends. The interface needs to be more intuitive, visually appealing, and functionally enhanced.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Modern, professional visual design following 2025 trends
- Enhanced user experience with better interactions
- Improved data visualization and dashboard metrics
- Advanced CRUD operations with search, filter, and bulk actions
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Dark/light mode theme switching
- Performance optimizations and loading states

### Non-Goals
- Complete framework migration (staying with TailwindCSS + Alpine.js)
- Breaking existing functionality
- Major architectural changes
- Complex animations that impact performance

## Decisions

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Maintain existing brand colors (Deep Blue, Light Blue, Bright Blue)
- **Typography**: Inter for body, Playfair Display for headings, JetBrains Mono for code
- **Components**: Card-based layouts with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4px grid system using TailwindCSS spacing

### UI Patterns
- **Dashboard**: Card-based statistics with icons and charts
- **Tables**: Striped rows, hover effects, sortable columns, search/filter bars
- **Forms**: Floating labels, inline validation, modal overlays for create/edit
- **Navigation**: Sidebar with collapsible sections, breadcrumbs
- **Feedback**: Toast notifications, loading spinners, confirmation dialogs

### Technical Implementation
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS utility classes with custom CSS for complex components
- **Interactivity**: Alpine.js for dynamic behavior and state management
- **Charts**: Chart.js or ApexCharts for data visualization
- **Icons**: Heroicons or Lucide icons for consistency
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risks
- **Performance**: Additional JavaScript and CSS may impact load times
- **Compatibility**: New components may not work in older browsers
- **Maintenance**: More complex UI requires ongoing maintenance

### Mitigations
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for charts, optimized images, minimal JavaScript
- **Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement, fallbacks for older browsers
- **Maintenance**: Well-documented components, consistent patterns

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Update base layout with new design system
2. Implement dark/light mode switching
3. Add loading states and transitions

### Phase 2: Dashboard
1. Redesign dashboard with modern cards
2. Add interactive charts and metrics
3. Implement responsive grid layouts

### Phase 3: CRUD Enhancement
1. Redesign table components with advanced features
2. Improve form layouts and validation
3. Add bulk operations and export functionality

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Add animations and micro-interactions
2. Optimize performance
3. Test across devices and browsers

## Open Questions

- Should we implement a design system documentation?
- What level of animation complexity is acceptable?
- Should we add keyboard shortcuts for power users?
- Do we need accessibility improvements beyond basic compliance?
