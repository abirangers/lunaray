## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Article Analytics
The system SHALL provide enhanced analytics for article performance with improved accuracy and performance.

#### Scenario: View article statistics
- **WHEN** a content manager or admin views article statistics
- **THEN** they can see accurate view counts that exclude duplicate views from the same user session
- **AND** the statistics exclude bot traffic for improved accuracy
- **AND** the view counts are updated efficiently through cache-based batch processing
- **AND** the statistics are updated in real-time with acceptable delay for performance optimization
- **AND** they can filter statistics by date range and category

#### Scenario: Article view tracking
- **WHEN** a user views an article for the first time in their session
- **THEN** the view count is incremented accurately
- **AND** subsequent views from the same user session are not counted to prevent duplicate tracking
- **AND** bot traffic is filtered out using user agent detection
- **AND** the view count update is processed through cache for improved performance

#### Scenario: View count performance optimization
- **WHEN** multiple users view articles simultaneously
- **THEN** view count updates are batched through cache to reduce database load
- **AND** the system maintains accurate view counts while improving response times
- **AND** cache-based updates are synchronized to the database periodically
- **AND** the system gracefully handles cache failures by falling back to direct database updates
