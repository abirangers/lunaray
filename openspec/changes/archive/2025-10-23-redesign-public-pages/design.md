## Context

The Lunaray Beauty Factory public-facing pages need a comprehensive redesign to align with 2025 design trends and improve user engagement. The current pages have functional but outdated designs that don't reflect the modern, professional brand identity needed for a beauty manufacturing company.

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Create modern, engaging public interface that reflects brand professionalism
- Implement 2025 design trends with clean, minimalist aesthetics
- Improve user experience with better navigation and interactions
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design across all devices
- Maintain consistent brand identity throughout public pages

### Non-Goals
- Complete redesign of admin interface (already completed)
- Backend functionality changes or API modifications
- Database schema changes or data migration
- Third-party service integrations beyond existing ones

## Decisions

### Design System
- **Decision**: Implement modern minimalist design with OKLCH color space
- **Rationale**: Provides better color consistency and accessibility
- **Alternatives considered**: Traditional hex colors (less consistent), HSL (limited color range)

### Typography
- **Decision**: Use Inter for body text, Playfair Display for headings
- **Rationale**: Inter provides excellent readability, Playfair adds elegance for beauty brand
- **Alternatives considered**: System fonts (less brand identity), other serif fonts (less elegant)

### Component Architecture
- **Decision**: Use TailwindCSS utility classes with custom component classes
- **Rationale**: Maintains consistency with admin interface, provides flexibility
- **Alternatives considered**: CSS-in-JS (not suitable for Laravel), separate CSS files (harder to maintain)

### Animation Strategy
- **Decision**: Use CSS transitions and Alpine.js for interactions
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, performant, and works well with Laravel
- **Alternatives considered**: Framer Motion (overkill), GSAP (too heavy)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Performance vs. Visual Appeal
- **Risk**: Heavy animations may impact page load times
- **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms, optimize images, lazy load animations

### Browser Compatibility
- **Risk**: Modern CSS features may not work in older browsers
- **Mitigation**: Use progressive enhancement, provide fallbacks

### Mobile Experience
- **Risk**: Complex layouts may not work well on small screens
- **Mitigation**: Mobile-first design approach, test on real devices

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Design System
1. Update TailwindCSS configuration with new color palette
2. Create component classes for public pages
3. Implement responsive breakpoints and spacing

### Phase 2: Page Redesigns
1. Redesign authentication pages
2. Update home page with modern hero section
3. Enhance chat interface
4. Redesign article pages

### Phase 3: Interactive Features
1. Add animations and micro-interactions
2. Implement smooth transitions
3. Add interactive elements

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
1. Cross-browser testing
2. Mobile device testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Accessibility validation

## Open Questions

- Should we implement a design system documentation page for future reference?
- Do we need to consider internationalization for the public pages?
- Should we add analytics tracking for user interactions on public pages?
