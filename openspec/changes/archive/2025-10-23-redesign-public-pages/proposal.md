## Why

The current public-facing pages (authentication, home, chat, and article pages) need a modern redesign to align with 2025 design trends and improve user experience. The existing pages have basic styling but lack the contemporary visual appeal, interactive elements, and user engagement features expected in modern web applications.

Key issues identified:
- Authentication pages use outdated design patterns and inconsistent styling
- Home page lacks modern hero sections and interactive elements
- Chat interface needs better UX and visual feedback
- Article pages require enhanced readability and social features
- Overall design lacks cohesive brand identity and modern aesthetics

## What Changes

- **Modern Authentication Design**: Redesign login/register pages with contemporary UI patterns, better visual hierarchy, and enhanced user experience
- **Enhanced Home Page**: Create engaging hero sections, interactive elements, and modern content presentation
- **Improved Chat Interface**: Redesign chatbot interface with better UX, visual feedback, and modern messaging patterns
- **Redesigned Article Pages**: Enhance article listing and detail pages with better typography, social features, and reading experience
- **Consistent Brand Identity**: Apply unified design system across all public pages with modern color schemes and typography
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Ensure all pages work seamlessly across all device sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Add modern animations, hover effects, and micro-interactions

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: web-platform (public interface redesign)
- **Affected code**:
  - `resources/views/auth/` (authentication pages)

  - `resources/css/app.css` (public styling)
  - `resources/js/app.js` (public interactions)
- **Breaking changes**: None - this is a visual and UX enhancement
- **Dependencies**: Requires TailwindCSS 4, Alpine.js, and modern browser support
